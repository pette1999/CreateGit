-Create a shell script and a python script for my terminal that will automate the process of creating new projects for me.
-Create a custom command that creates a folder, adds it to my desired directory, opens a web browser, navigates to GitHub, logs in to my account, creates a new repository, then adds the git remote to my local folder, adds a README file, does git add, and then does a commit called “initial commit” and then pushes this to master.
